            happiness
            everywhere. This cultural diversity intrigues everyone across the world. With so many religions and customs,
            India never
            stops to amaze the global citizens.

            vast
            geographical region. There’s a new custom, every mile you cross, and each stranger than the one before.

            The most
            famous ones are Diwali, Holi, Christmas and Eid.
            Having already established and reiterated the diverse culture of India, it would be fair to say that each of
            their
            cuisines are highly influenced by their geographical location and what grows the most and best on the land.
            This leads
            to a huge variety of cuisines, each unique and stunning in taste. While the Indian curry is much famous,
            there are
            regional delicacies and sweets that rule the food palate.
